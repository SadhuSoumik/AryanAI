Machine learning is the study of algorithms that can learn from data.
Natural language processing involves teaching computers to understand human language.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to solve complex problems.
Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms.
The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
Training a neural network involves adjusting weights to minimize prediction errors.
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to train neural networks.
Backpropagation is the process of computing gradients for neural network training.
The loss function measures how well the model's predictions match the true labels.
Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
The learning rate controls how quickly the model updates its parameters during training.
Batch size determines how many examples are processed before updating model weights.
Epochs refer to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model.
Feature engineering involves creating meaningful input features for machine learning models.
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing raw data for model training.
Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting model settings to optimize performance.
